# Automatic Detection and Analysis of TD in R Packages
We developed an automatic system to detect TD in peer-review issue comments of R packages. We conducted an empirical study of different TDs in R.

## Different Types of TD in R
* Architecture Debt
* Build Debt
* Code Debt
* Defect Debt
* Design Debt
* Documentation Debt
* Requirement Debt
* Test Debt
* Usability Debt
* Versioning Debt

## R Platforms
* rOpenSci (https://ropensci.org/)
* BioConductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/)

## Automatic Detection
We developed a two-stage hierarchical BERT-based system to detect the type of TD.

## Empirical Study
We automatically labelled large-scale R issue comments from rOpenSci and BioConductor with our automated model and conducted empirical study on them.

## Code
You will find the codes of this project under the 'codes' directory. The codes are organised in a sequential manner.
